### Step :one: Create a repository :

---

- repository as a folder that contains related items, such as files, images, videos, or even other folders

- epository usually groups together items that belong to the same "project" or thing you're working on

- repositories must be include a README file, a file with information about your project

- GitHub also offers other common options such as a license file

### Step :two: Create a branch :

- Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time

- By default, your repository has one branch named main

- You can create additional branches off of main in your repository

- Branching is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code

- The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it

- You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main

- When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time

- if someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

- **Creating a branch** :

1. Click the Code tab of your repository
2. Above the file list, click the dropdown menu that says main
3. type a branch name, readme-edits, into the text box
4. Click Create branch: readme-edits from main
5. Now you have two branches :smile:
6. they look exactly the same. Next you'll add changes to the new readme-edits branch

### Step :three: Make and commit changes :

- On GitHub, saved changes are called commits.

- Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made, to understand what you’ve done and why

- changes will be made only to the bransh, so now this branch contains content that's different from main.

### Step :four: Open a pull request :

- Now that you have changes in a branch off of main, you can open a pull request

- Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub.

- When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch

- Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches

- The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors

- if you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

  - **open a pull request and  then merge the branch !!** :
